# hamming-distance-ts

Hamming distance in TypeScript.

## Motivation

There are other pure JS hamming distance libraries out there that I could have written a TypeScript declration file for, but I wanted to learn about writing and publishing TypeScript libraries and I needed hamming distance computation for another project.

## Usage

`npm install --save hamming-distance-ts`

Now you can have your Hamming distances and some types too!
